# Gee-Web

This repo contains my implementation of [7days-golang/gee-web](https://github.com/geektutu/7days-golang/tree/master/gee-web).

Gee is a Gin-like web framework.

Each day's code builds upon the code implemented in the previous day.

*   Day1：utilizes the HTTP library to construct a preliminary prototype of the Gee framework.
*   Day2：implement Context that encapsulates the request, responseWriter, and other related information.
*   Day3：implement Trie to parse routing.
*   Day4：implement router group
*   Day5：implement middleware mechanism
*   Day6：implement template
*   Day7：implement panic recovery
